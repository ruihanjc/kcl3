\chapter{Introduction}


The Nucleic acid sequence is the set of characters that biologists use to represent the order of the nuclearbase (base) 
of DNA or RNA, the four letters used to represent are A, C, G and T (representing adenine, cytosine, guanine and 
thymine), in case of RNA, U (Uracil) would replace T. 

Every base sequence has its complementary as well as the characters, the letters are paired as A for T and C for G, so 
for example, the complementary sequence of ``ATCG'' would be ``TAGC''. This is essentially a stringology research, 
analyzing the sequence of the genetic code is important for the bioinformatics as this can be used to understand why
some living thing functions that way and also compare the sequence alignment to highlight the relationship between
different sequences. 
 
\section{Motivation}

After this long period of Covid pandemic, I understood how biology has such an impactful influence to our life, but at 
the same time I also noticed the benefits that computing can bring to traditional biology, eventhough there are already
algorithms that can solve the problem fair easily, however, I will focus my research on a more specific topic. The 
efficiency when calculating the sequence analysis can be resolved by better algorithm designs, as programmers, we 
can provide a better environment for other scientific researches. 

\section{Project aims}

The main objective of the project would be the deep research on Longest Common Subsequence problem which matches with
the concept of sequence alignment in biology, being a NP-Complete problem also aligns with the Computer Science theme. 
To go further with the idea of more efficiency, I want to compare different algorithms with some other s to see the 
differences in different dimensions (Speed would be one dimension as well as space). I will research and explain
the background logic of different kind of algorithms and also build my own one and also compare it with other ones.

The other objective would be the idea of building an algorithm application that can be used for a real-life scenario,
performing different experiments and functionalities, so for biologists who are not that familiar with computing can 
use the program or even build a similar one by just reading this project. 


\section{Report Structure}

The report will be started with a bit of background information about the concept of NP and NP-Completeness, as well
as understanding what is the Longest Common Subsequence problem and how its importance in biological researches by 
reviewing real life examples.

The next part would begin with understanding different kind of algorithms to solve LCS problems and compare them, this
section will also contain the problems of those algorithms and conclude with an idea that would fit best for a real life
scenario by analyzing in different complexity dimensions.

The following section will follow with implementation of the algorithm as well as creating the final product for the
research and also some testing of both real-life and hypothetical scenarios and providing the evidences of its viability.

Finally, the report will cover the considerations of ethical, professional and legal issues during the process of
development, and at last, it there will be a conclusion chapter which summarizes the learning curve and final outcome,
and also a small view for a future deeper research.
